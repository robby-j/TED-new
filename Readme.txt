This is the Github, for the planned Hearts of Iron IV Mod, the Eagle Drowns, a comprehensive alternate history timeline, where the Soviet Union has performed better than OTL in the Cold War and the world is trending away from the status quo, in alternate 90s radicalism festers from the National Party of Europe and the Eurocommunism in Western Europe and in America, theocratic sentiments run rampant and to the USSR where an underground russian supremacy movement looms. Stand up and make the world your's or destroy it your choice.
